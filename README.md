## üñ•Ô∏è Charles Proxy

During the functional software testing course I learned how to work with traffic sniffers such as Charles Proxy, Fiddler, Proxyman. Using a <a href="http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/cart">demo online store cart</a>, I completed the following tasks:

```git
1.1. The request sends 2 items and the response returns 500 items
1.2. Change the response status code from 200 to 403
1.3. Redirect the request from "Prod" to "QA" 
```
I used Charles Proxy to complete the task. The site was opened in the Google Chrome browser on a laptop running the Windows operating system.

```git
2.1. Delete items from the cart
2.2. Replace website with a picture
```
I used Charles Proxy to complete the task. The site was opened in the Google Chrome browser on a Google Nexus One running the Android 8.1 (emulated on Android Studio Giraffe).
